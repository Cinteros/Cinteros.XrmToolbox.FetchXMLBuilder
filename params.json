{"name":"FetchXML Builder","tagline":"for XrmToolbox - create and run advanced FetchXML queries","body":"# FetchXML Builder for XrmToolBox\r\n*Written by Jonas Rapp at Cinteros AB, Stockholm, Sweden.*\r\n\r\nThis tool is a plugin to the [XrmToolBox](http://xrmtoolbox.codeplex.com/) by [Tanguy Touzard](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/tanguy92).\r\n\r\n## *> [Download here](http://github.com/cinteros/Cinteros.XrmToolbox.FetchXMLBuilder/releases) <*\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nAs many other CRM developers, I used to use **Stunnware Tools** extensively to query the CRM database for information and to assist me when creating fetch xml to be used in our solutions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this tool was discontinued, and I have found no good substitute. So the time was ripe to do something about it myself!\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get a jump start is – of course – to create it as a plugin to the XrmToolBox. Then I wouldn't have to deal with the hassles of connecting to CRM, storing configurations etc. And it would also provide a platform that is recognized throughout the CRM community, which of course would help spreading the tool.\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\n\r\n*The goal is to create a tool that will assist you in the following areas:*\r\n\r\nConstructing FetchXML in ways that Advanced Find cannot\r\n- aggregates\r\n- outer joins\r\n- \"has no\"-queries\r\n- attributes from linked entities\r\n- join on other fields than relationships\r\n\r\nQuerying CRM for information not (easily) found in the CRM UI\r\n- system entities\r\n- \"hidden\" attributes\r\n\r\nDeveloper assistance\r\n- Generate C# QueryExpression code from fetch xml\r\n\r\nThe tool reads metadata from CRM to assist with selecting entities, attributes, relations and to perform validation of condition values.\r\n\r\nTo make it more appealing, there is also the possibility to have it show \"Friendly names\", which will replace the technical names of entities and attributes with their display names in the users' currently selected language, much like Advanced Find does.\r\n\r\n### Information\r\n\r\nSome screen shots are available under [Wiki](http://github.com/cinteros/Cinteros.XrmToolbox.FetchXMLBuilder/wiki). More info will be posted :) \r\n\r\nFeedback is much appreciated, post issues and suggestions under  [Issues](http://github.com/cinteros/Cinteros.XrmToolbox.FetchXMLBuilder/issues)!\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThis tool was \"inspired by\" the [Sitemap](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=xrmtoolbox&DownloadId=776491) Editor and a few other tools written by Tanguy and inherits the [`PluginBase`](http://xrmtoolbox.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#XrmToolBox/XrmToolBox/PluginBase.cs) class by [Daryl LaBar](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/hulk2484).\r\n","google":"UA-41153925-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
